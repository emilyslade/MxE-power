This repository contains files relevant to the manuscript: Slade, E. &amp; Kraft, P. (2016). Leveraging methylome-environment interaction to detect genetic determinants of disease. Hum Hered, 8(1): 26-34.

MxEpower.R contains the following:
 - Description of function arguments and output
 - R function for computing power of three tests: (1) standard test for main effect of methylation, (2) standard test for methylation-environment interaction, and (3) joint methylation-environment interaction test
 - Example demonstrating power calculation for continuous exposure when there is no measurement error in the exposure and no methylation-environment dependence
